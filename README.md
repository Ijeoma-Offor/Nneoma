## Introduction

**Preamble**

Our dear people of Ngwo, the *Call* for Ngwo-Centricity is a clarion call for thinking homewards and working towards helping our people and also ourselves because in the process, we're making our Homebase a better place. Let us encourage ourselves to continue to do the needful. If we can get down to seeing what we as Ngwo People, including the Elites can focus on - what we can do for ourselves, we will be surprised at the high level of progress that can be achieved.

For one, the chains of pessimism and unbridled criticism that traps creativity and innovation will be eliminated. The looking out only for things to attack and things to defend ourselves against will be destroyed.

We shall never be part of denigrating or neglecting the days of small beginnings. Forgetting what lies behind and pressing on to the upward call of being a positive instrument for positive, selfless and sacrificial impact is the way to go; including forgiving ourselves and others for any missteps.

It is pertinent to recap a few of the things that the awesome Volunteers of the Ngwo Yellow Pages Team have already been able to achieve this year, 2023, through the help of God and a solid resolution to deliver:

1. Partnership with Distinguished *Senator Osita Ngwu* on Recruitment and Job placements for our Young Unemployed Ones and Collation of Names of Over a dozen Ngwo Young ones for Special Skill Training such as the upcoming SONGHAI BOOTCAMP Training Program etc.

2. Partnership with *Senator Osita Ngwu* for collation of our Youths seeking admission into Public Tertiary Institutions.

3. Partnership with *Uncle Ricky Agu* and the COPEN family for the Enugu Amadeo Economic Summit and several COPEN IT Training Programs for several Ngwo People, Partnerships with *Mrs Ada Agu* (SME Enugu State) and *Miss Ezinne Agu* for Women Empowerment Opportunities and Grants.

4. A Comprehensive Analysis of the State of all the Public Schools in Ngwo land and passing the detailed recommendations to the Distinguished Senator and *Minority Whip of the Senate.*

5. The Creation of the Ngwo Yellow Pages Website/Portal for the NYP Team, Ngwo JAMB Academy and other Ngwo Yellow Pages Community Development Initiatives.

6. Kick off of the *Ngwo JAMB Academy* as a result of the Ngwo JAMB Preparatory Scheme and the enrollment of *over 200 students* into the *Tuition-free* Ngwo JAMB Academy.

7. The recruitment of a 17-man staff at the Ngwo JAMB Academy which include the Academy Administrator and Teachers.

8. Commencement of Lessons at the Initial Venue of the Academy: Ave Maria Schools on Tuesday, 5th September after the Student's Orientation Exercise which held on Monday, 4th September, 2023.

9. The Very First CBT of the Academy Students held on Saturday, 30th September at the Digital Global Institute, an ICT Center located in IMT Campus 3, Enugu. This CBT is now being conducted every month and was last held for this year 2023 on Tuesday, 19th December. This CBT was for these students to be able to have a hands-on experience on JAMB Exam modalities and to help the students practice diligently. The progress and detailed analysis of the Students' Results were regularly brought out to the open in order to help everyone see the process and progress.

10. The NYP Team have also been Conducting Monthly CBT assessment for the Academy‚Äòs Teachers during which we reshuffled and recruited teachers as the need arose.

11. The NYP Team with the concerted collaboration of Distinguished Senator Osita Ngwu was able to move the venue of the Ngwo JAMB Academy to the National Youth Center, Ishiokpoto, Ngwo creating a more ambient environment for studies.

12. The Senator Visited the Ngwo JAMB Academy on Saturday, 25th November, 2023 and had an extensive Interactive Session with the NYP Team, Staff and Students of the Ngwo JAMB Academy and others present. It is worthy to emphasize on the high impactful level of this interactive session he had, especially with the Academy Students. He relived the entire plan of the Team to the Academy and confirmed that the Team is willing to do its best for the Students, especially those who wish to be the best versions of themselves.

13. The Academy welcomed *Rev Dr Charles AGU* who also visited and had a very pleasant experience with the Students. The NYP Team is very grateful for his visit. It surely yielded fruits.

14. The NYP Tech Team introduced the Ngwo Job placements interface on the NYP Website/Portal called the JOB POOL for collation of unemployed youths of Ngwo.

15. The NYP Team in Partnership with The Evergreen Group Foundation held a continuous Teacher's Training Program for Primary School Teachers and Proprietors of Public and Private Schools in and around Ngwo. This Program held every Saturday from the month of November, 2023 at the Hidden Treasure High School and will resume activities in January...
... Possibly the last but not the least

16. The Regular Monday Hot Seat Sessions which have been holding every other Monday. To say that these Sessions have been highly impactful wouldn't be an over-the-top statement but the fact.

- Ngwo Yellow Pages Team may not be able to fully enumerate all of its activities for this year, but these above few are the highlights.
